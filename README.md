In this paper, we propose a supervised-learning-based spatial performance prediction (SLPP) framework for next-generation heterogeneous communication networks (HCNs). A robust network performance prediction framework for optimizing performance and resource utilization through a linear-discriminant-analysis-based prediction approach has been proposed in this paper. Comparison results with different machine learning techniques on real-world data demonstrate that SLPP provides superior accuracy and computational efficiency for both stationary and mobile user conditions.
